# Activity Inference

Simple android app that tracks user's location and infers his activity.

The first part of the app was developed by following this [tutorial](https://www.androidhive.info/2017/12/android-user-activity-recognition-still-walking-running-driving-etc/).
On the way I transformed it from Java to Kotlin and afterwards I plan to add new features and extend it further.
